# Peekaboo MCP Review - MVP Level

## Overview
Peekaboo MCP is a minimal Model Context Protocol server for read-only file system access. The codebase is clean, focused, and follows KISS principles well. It's a solid MVP implementation with room for practical improvements.

## What's Good âœ…
- **Security First**: Path traversal protection is properly implemented
- **Simple Architecture**: Clear separation between server setup, file utils, and types
- **TypeScript**: Proper typing with strict mode enabled
- **Error Handling**: Appropriate MCP error codes and messages
- **MVP Focus**: Does one thing well - read-only file access

## Actionable Issues & Improvements

### 1. Code Quality & Structure
- [ ] **Missing file extension handling**: All files return 'text/plain' MIME type regardless of actual type
- [ ] **Inconsistent error handling**: Some errors expose internal paths which could be a security concern
- [ ] **No file size limits**: Large files could cause memory issues when read entirely into memory
- [ ] **Missing recursive directory listing**: Only lists immediate children, not full tree

### 2. Security Concerns
- [ ] **Symlink handling**: No explicit handling of symbolic links - could potentially escape root
- [ ] **Binary file handling**: Attempting to read binary files as UTF-8 will fail or corrupt
- [ ] **Resource exhaustion**: No limits on directory listing size or concurrent operations

### 3. Missing Functionality
- [ ] **No file filtering**: Can't filter by extension or pattern during listing
- [ ] **No metadata**: Missing useful info like file permissions, creation time
- [ ] **No search capability**: Can't search for files by name or content
- [ ] **No caching**: Repeatedly reading same files hits disk every time

### 4. Performance Considerations
- [ ] **Synchronous path operations**: Using sync path.resolve could block event loop
- [ ] **No streaming**: Files loaded entirely into memory before sending
- [ ] **No pagination**: Large directories returned all at once

### 5. Developer Experience
- [ ] **No CLI bin entry**: package.json missing "bin" field for npx usage
- [ ] **Missing dist folder**: Build artifacts not gitignored
- [ ] **No proper logging**: Console.error for startup message mixes with actual errors
- [ ] **Test coverage**: Only manual test client, no automated tests
- [ ] **Documentation gaps**: No API examples or error code documentation

### 6. Package & Distribution
- [ ] **Missing files field**: package.json should specify which files to publish
- [ ] **No prepublish script**: TypeScript not automatically built before publish
- [ ] **Missing repository field**: No link to source code in package.json
- [ ] **No .npmignore**: Test files would be included in published package

## MVP Priority Fixes

### High Priority (Security/Functionality)
1. Add symlink detection and handling
2. Implement proper MIME type detection
3. Add file size limit for reads (e.g., 10MB default)
4. Add bin entry to package.json for npx usage

### Medium Priority (UX/Performance)
1. Add basic file filtering to list operation
2. Implement proper error messages without exposing paths
3. Add build script to package.json prepublishOnly
4. Create .npmignore file

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. Add simple LRU cache for frequently read files
2. Support streaming for large files
3. Add recursive directory traversal option
4. Implement basic search functionality

## Conclusion
This is a well-architected MVP that follows KISS principles. The code is clean and does what it promises. The suggested improvements focus on practical enhancements that maintain simplicity while addressing real-world usage concerns. Most critical are the security improvements around symlinks and resource limits.
